**ldragoon/ldragoon** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on CATALYST
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning RStudio
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Fighting Anti-Blackness, Jew-Hatred, misogyny, and queerphobia
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with data science and statistics
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about comics, Holocaust education, children's books, restorative gardening, gardening with bird help
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: figure it out
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: SHE/HER
- âš¡ Fun fact: This one time my dad almost dropped a Christmas tree on my head from 60 ft up.
