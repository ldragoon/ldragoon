### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm so happy I can finally get started on my R Studio 101 Self-Documenting Statistics Project/Tutorial/Repository

1. [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/) - Download IDE (integrated development environment) from here
2. [CURL package for R](https://cran.r-project.org/web//packages/curl/vignettes/intro.html) - pronounced "curl". Used to transfer data using various network protocols. Acronym stands for "Client for URL" [curl wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL).
3. [A command-line tool to download photos from iCloud](https://github.com/icloud-photos-downloader/icloud_photos_downloader) - volunteer project so we're going to give it a shot and see if it compiles and works, I'll have to hop onto my Windows PC for that. That's where I have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com), [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and all that jazz.
