### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm so happy I can finally get started on my R Studio 101 Self-Documenting Statistics Project/Tutorial/Repository

1. [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/) - Download IDE (integrated development environment) from here
2. [CURL package for R](https://cran.r-project.org/web//packages/curl/vignettes/intro.html) - pronounced "curl". Used to transfer data using various network protocols. Acronym stands for "Client for URL" [curl wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL).
